# rougelike-prototype

## Current Build
There are currently two different builds of the game that are being evaluated for further iterations. The first is a traditional turn based rouge-like where the world moves when you do. This is the easiest to iterate on and balance due to the simpler rule set. The second is a free moving action RPG style where time slows when you stop moving. 

**Testing Notes**
* It is recommended to play the game windowed at 1024 x 768 until other resolutions have been tested.
* The game is very simple and is only meant to evaluate mechanics. More features will be added once the game's core mechanics are decided and play tested.
* Please evaluate mechanics not on the fidelity or balancing, but on the potential for fun gameplay. If the system does not seem fun, please submit a feedback issue. Instructions for how to do so are located at the bottom of the screen.

### v3 Grid Based
* A simple grid-based rogue where every turn you take the enemy moves. 
* The enemy skips every other turn so they are perceived to always be "Slower". 
* Most actions and combat are performed simply by walking into items and enemies. 
* There is only one ability to repair yourself with the F key. 
* The goal is to see how many zones you can go through before running out of energy or dying. 
* Energy is expended by moving or attacking and can be replenished by crystals. 
* Plants and ruins can be destroyed to create new paths through the level.

### v4 Zelda Style
* Action RPG style where the enemies slow down to 5% time speed when you stop moving.
* Enemies can be slower or faster than the player.
* The player can execute a dash attack by pointing the cursor in the direction of the attack and left clicking.
* There is only one ability to repair yourself with the right mouse button.
* The goal is to see how many zones you can go through before running out of energy or dying. 
* Energy is expended by moving or attacking and can be replenished by crystals. 
* Plants and ruins can be destroyed to create new paths through the level.
* Crystals sometimes drop from enemies.
